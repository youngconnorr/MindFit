# Mindfit 🧠
(this is an updated version of a hackathon project)
We were inspired by the fact that we all love exercise, but can never seem to find the time as university students! Thus, we wanted to find a way to package exercise so as to be realistic to fit into a student's busy schedule.

## What it does 🤔
Mindfit essentially distills the core considerations of students into a few questions: how much time they have right now to exercise, their goals, desired intensity, etc. With this data, we assign them a tailored outdoor exercise for the time limit they set so that they can at least introduce some movement into their day.

## How we built it 🛠️
We tackled the development of Mindfit by leveraging React and Firebase. Our team worked tirelessly to integrate omnichannel features, overcoming challenges in scaling and implementing novel solutions. Despite facing hurdles in AI integration and CSS implementation, we persevered to create a seamless user experience.

## Accomplishments that we're proud of 📈
We take pride in creating a project that brings people closer to themselves and the earth through exercise. Moreover, devising a realistic business model capable of generating profit underscores our commitment to innovation. We're proud of our teamwork, resilience, and positivity, as evidenced by our all-night collaboration sessions.

## What we learned ✏️
Our journey with Mindfit taught us invaluable lessons. We discovered the power of teamwork in overcoming challenges, the time-intensive nature of full-stack, and the potential of collaborating with reputable brands like Arc'teryx.

## What's next for Mindfit 📖
Looking ahead, we aim to enhance Mindfit's capabilities through LLM implementation, user preference tracking, and monetization via subscription plans. Additionally, we aspire to deepen our collaboration with Arc'teryx, exploring new avenues for innovation and growth.
